Web Stack Outage Incident
Overview
On March 9, 2024, from 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC, our web application experienced a critical outage, resulting in service disruption for approximately 30% of our users. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to increased latency and eventual service degradation.

Issue Summary
Duration: March 9, 2024, 12:00 PM to 2:00 PM UTC
Impact: 30% of users experienced service disruption, leading to increased latency and errors.
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings.
Timeline
11:45 AM UTC: Issue first detected through monitoring alerts showing increased latency.
11:50 AM UTC: Engineers noticed abnormal server behavior and began investigating.
12:00 PM UTC: Initial assumption was high server load due to increased traffic.
12:15 PM UTC: Load balancer settings were reviewed, but no issues were found.
12:30 PM UTC: Issue escalated to senior engineering team for further investigation.
1:00 PM UTC: Misconfiguration in load balancer settings identified as root cause.
1:30 PM UTC: Load balancer settings were corrected to restore normal service.
2:00 PM UTC: Service fully restored for all users.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: Misconfiguration in the load balancer settings caused traffic to be improperly distributed, leading to increased latency and service disruption.
Resolution: Load balancer settings were corrected to evenly distribute traffic across servers, resolving the latency and service disruption issues.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements/Fixes: Implement stricter monitoring of load balancer settings to catch misconfigurations early. Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to ensure they align with best practices.
Tasks to Address:
Patch load balancer software to prevent similar misconfigurations.
Implement automated testing of load balancer settings to detect anomalies.
Update incident response plan to include specific steps for load balancer issues.
Lessons Learned
This incident highlighted the importance of regularly auditing and monitoring critical infrastructure components like load balancers. Implementing stricter monitoring and automated testing can help detect and prevent similar issues in the future, ensuring a more reliable service for our users.

By adhering to these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the risk of similar outages and maintain a high level of service availability for our users.
